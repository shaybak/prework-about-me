      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Shayda. I have a master's degree in creative writing, which naturally lead to a deep and abiding interest
        in learning to code. I love all things sci-fi, fantasy, and Scarface. In my spare time, I'm fond
        of taking on ambitious creative projects, and as a result generally have no spare time.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Cedar Park.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love video games, reading, writing, and obsessively restructuring my Google calendars. I play an
        inordinate amount of Age of Empires II.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I thrive in working environments where I can apply both creativity and precision to build projects.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Austin.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I stumbled into coding by a happy accident of circumstances in my current role, and realized I really enjoyed it. 
        I also realized the creativity and idea-building I love so much in writing exists in web development as well,
        and I can't wait to learn more.
